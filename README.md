Security Implementation
The application uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. The workflow is:

Users log in with credentials through a secure endpoint
Server validates credentials and issues a JWT token
Token is stored client-side and sent with subsequent requests
Server validates token for protected resources based on user role
Tokens expire after a configured time period for enhanced security

Role-Based Access Control

Admin: Complete system control, user management, and analytics access
Guide: Profile management, tour scheduling, and client communication
Tourist: Destination browsing, booking services, and review submission
Business Partner: Service listing management and booking tracking

API Endpoints
The system exposes RESTful endpoints organized by domain:

/api/auth/* - Authentication and user management
/api/destinations/* - Destination information and search
/api/accommodations/* - Accommodation listing and booking
/api/tours/* - Tour information and reservations
/api/guides/* - Guide profiles and availability
/api/transportation/* - Transport options and bookings
/api/reviews/* - Customer feedback and ratings
